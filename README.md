### Abstract

We conclude that when we are constructing a nuclear reactor, the following factors affects its cost a lot: -

1)	Country where the reactor is being built.
2)	Reactor Type (eg. PWR, BWR, FBR, PHWR etc.)
3)	Gross Capacity in MWe (i.e. how much electricity can the nuclear reactor generate)
4)	Duration (Number of years the reactor took to get built)
5)	Average Concrete Price
